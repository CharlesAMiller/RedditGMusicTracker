## About
This was a quick weekend project inspired by [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/9e3vkk/i_made_a_spotify_playlist_that_gets_the_top_new/).
A big big thanks to [Spotify Discover Weekly Sync](https://github.com/moxuz/spotify-discover-weekly-sync) for giving me a basis for fuzzy string matching.
